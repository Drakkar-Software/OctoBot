# Contribute to OctoBot

Feel like OctoBot is missing a feature? We welcome your pull requests! 

Few pointers for contributions:

- Create your PR against the dev branch, not master.
- New features need to contain unit tests and must be PEP8 compliant (max-line-length = 100).
    
# OctoBot additional coding style

- Use local variable only if it improves code clarity
- Always use comprehension list
- Use `try ... except` instead of `if` statetements when `if` is 99% `True`
