# Contribute to OctoBot

Feel like our bot is missing a feature? We welcome your pull requests! Few pointers for contributions:

    Create your PR against the develop branch, not master.
    New features need to contain unit tests and must be PEP8 conformant (max-line-length = 100).
    
# OctoBot additional coding style

- Use local variable only if it improves code clarity
- Always use comprehension list
- Use `try ... except` instead of `if` statetements when `if` is 99% `True`
