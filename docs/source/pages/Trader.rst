Open your **user/config.json** file and edit this configuration :

.. code-block:: json

   "trader":{
     "enabled": true
   }

Enabled
^^^^^^^

The **Enabled** parameter is to be set at **true** when OctoBot should trade real cryptocurrencies. 
When **false** OctoBot will never any create a real trade. This **false** value can be used to make OctoBot only use its simulation mode on real market conditions.

Trading settings
-----------------

.. code-block:: json

   "trading":{
     "reference-market": "BTC",
     "risk": 0.8
   }

Reference-market
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The **Reference-market** parameter defines which currency OctBot should use as a reference, this reference is used to compute profitability. 

Risk
^^^^

The **Risk** parameter defines the behaviour of OctoBot in an optimism manner.

It is a value between 0 and 1:


* A low risk (closer to 0) will make OctoBot a very safe trader with few bold moves and mostly small trades. A 0 risk bot is very pessimistic (regarding its orders creation) and does not expect big market moves.
* A high risk (closer to 1) will make OctoBot a very active and heavy trader. A 1 risk bot is very optimistic (regarding its orders creation) and is expecting significative market moves.

Trader simulator
----------------

Additionally to the real trading system, a trading simulator is available in OctoBot.
