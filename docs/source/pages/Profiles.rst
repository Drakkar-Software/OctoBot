Profiles
^^^^^^^^

OctoBot's trading configuration is using profiles (located into user/profiles).
This allows for quick switches between previously set configurations.

Profiles include:


* Tentacles activations
* Tentacles configurations
* Traded pairs
* Enabled exchanges
* Trading configuration

Login related data (exchange api keys, telegram settings, ...) are not stored in profiles.

Profiles can also be shared and imported between OctoBot's users.
