OctoBot 0.4
===========

About OctoBot 0.4
-----------------

..

   OctoBot 0.4.0 uses python 3.8


OctoBot 0.4 is a complete rework of OctoBot, while it doesn't change a lot on the appearance (for now), its core engine is completely different.\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`
With 0.4, OctoBot uses an asynchronous producer/consumer design. This enables deep optimizations by removing every downtime and therefore taking every signal opportunity as soon as possible without being overwhelmed by information. This is ideal for websocket connexions and enables the full potential of any strategy. 

To go even further on the optimization path, OctoBot is now using `Cython <https://cython.org/>`_ to compile its CPU intensive processes into efficient C code and increase its performances.

What's new on OctoBot 0.4 ?
---------------------------

High speed trading
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Thanks to its increased performances, OctoBot is now suitable for arbitrage, leverage trading, future trading, order book analysis and more. Trading on these products is not available yet but it will come in the the near future with dedicated trading strategies. 

This is the main feature of this new version and is paving the way to many more trading strategies and possibilities.

Inifinite customization
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Each and every OctoBot interface is now a tentacle, meaning it can easily be customized and improved. This makes it easy to plug a anything into OctoBot from a system getting data from another website to a websocket exchange connexion or even an sms command interface, basically anything.

Improved backtesting
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Starting from 0.4, OctoBot will be able to process backtestings with all of its price data based trading strategies. Multi-exchanges backtestings is also possible and accurate.

Improved web interface
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

OctoBot's web interface now has a much stronger server side, this enabled more reactivity and a smoother user experience.

OctoBot CLI
~~~~~~~~~~~

..

   OctoBot 0.4.0 uses python 3.8


To install OctoBot 0.4, the easiest way is to use `the OctoBot CLI <https://pypi.org/project/OctoBot-CLI/>`_ to install OctoBot 0.4 either using docker or python directly.


#. Install octobot-cli using the following command:
   .. code-block::

      python -m pip install octobot_cli

#. Go to the directory you want your OctoBot0.4 to be installed
#. Now two possibilities: you can install OctoBot using python (pip and virtual env), it is preferred way for Windows users or using docker if you are familiar with it.

For a python installation open a terminal and type in:

.. code-block::

   octobot_cli install --python

For a docker installation, open a terminal and type in:

.. code-block::

   octobot_cli install --docker

Note: if you are on an arm architecture (like on raspberry pie), add the ``--arm`` argument to the docker command.


#. Start your OctoBot using the following command:
   Python installations:
   .. code-block::

      octobot_cli start
   Docker installations:
   .. code-block::

      octobot_cli start --docker
   ### OctoBot 0.4 update
   To update your OctoBot, use the following command:
   Python installations:
   .. code-block::

      octobot_cli update
   Docker installations:
   .. code-block::

      octobot_cli update --docker
   This will update your OctoBot with its dependencies and tentacles

Manual installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**With the OctoBot executable**\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`
Download and start the latest OctoBot 0.4.0 executable for your computer from https://github.com/Drakkar-Software/OctoBot-Binary/releases.\ :raw-html-m2r:`<br>`
The first start will setup your OctoBot environment and download tentacles.

**With Docker**


#. Get the latest Octobot 0.4 image:
   .. code-block::

      docker pull drakkarsoftware/octobot:0.4.0-stable

#. Run it via
   .. code-block::

      docker run -it -d --name Octobot -p 5001:5001 -v $(pwd)/user:/octobot/user -v $(pwd)/tentacles:/octobot/tentacles -v $(pwd)/logs:/octobot/logs drakkarsoftware/octobot:0.4.0-stable

#. Follow the `docker help wiki <https://github.com/Drakkar-Software/OctoBot/wiki/With-Docker#how-to-look-at-octobot-logs->`_ if you need more details about how to use OctoBot with Docker.

**With Python**

..

   It is strongly advised to install OctoBot in a **virtual env** when installing it from python directly.



#. Clone the `OctoBot 0.4 branch <https://github.com/Drakkar-Software/OctoBot/tree/0.4.0>`_
   .. code-block::

      git clone -b 0.4.0 https://github.com/Drakkar-Software/OctoBot

#. 
   Install the requirements via

   .. code-block::

      pip install --prefer-binary -Ur requirements.txt

   **--prefer-binary** is important here otherwise you will have to recompile every module: it requires a c++ compiler and can be very slow.

#. 
   Start your OctoBot using 

   .. code-block::

      python start.py

**Using CentOS**

Requirements

.. code-block:: bash
